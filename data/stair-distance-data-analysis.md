# Stair distance auto sensor calibration analysis

Analysis of the first test with auto sensor calibration.
Just checking what the peaks are when my hand goes in front of the sensor.
Also to check what happens with the average when my hand goes away again.

## Result

On line 1295 to 1301 is a peak: 41 to 31 and 40 to 29.
Total peak = 10 and 11

Then on line 1301 to 1305 the hand is gone and it goes to the original of 43.

From 1305 to 1339 are numerous peaks and an lower average.

Then the average slowly goes lower to 34.

On line 3263 to 3300 is another peak where the distance goes down and back up again.
The biggest peak = 19.
